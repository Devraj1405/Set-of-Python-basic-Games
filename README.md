# Set-of-Python-basic-codes
This repository contains 3 codes, The first one is for a dice roll, u can have as many number of sides you want for your custom dice. The second one is a Number Guessing Game, the code guesses a number and you will be guessing it and you will get hints based on the number you enter. The third and the final one is a Tic Tac Toe game, it has always been my favorite game as I was unbeatable at it. So I decided to code this game for a Player vs Computer. Have Fun !!
